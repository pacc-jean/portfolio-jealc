        Iâ€™m Jean Luc Kajuga â€” a full-stack software engineer with a passion for solving real problems through clean, creative code.
        I studied software engineering at Moringa School and graduated in November 2024. Since then, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills through
        real-world experience, currently volunteering at Voice Of Reconciliation and Pacification (VORP-EA), and building custom solutions like a full website
        for a local Bed & Breakfast.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-3xl">
        I love bringing ideas to life â€” from backend logic to frontend polish â€” using tools like React, Next.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Node.js, Python, and more. Whether Iâ€™m designing in Figma, automating with Google APIs, or tweaking layouts in CSS, Iâ€™m all in.
